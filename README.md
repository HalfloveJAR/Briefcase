DISCLAIMER

All my commissioned spigot plugins are set to private on my GitHub page if the price of the commission is $25 USD or more. This commission was not $25 USD or more, therefore, it is marked as a public repository on my GitHub account to contribute to my portfolio. In the future, I will have a portfolio on https://Halflove.us that does not show all of the code in my project. Until that point, commissions under $25 will be displayed publicly on this page.

Thank you :)
